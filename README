### Hashtag Search

A simple app using the Twitter API and jQuery AJAX calls.

On the Javascript side, there's two global objects. One represents the Twitter feed, the other a row, or tweet, in the display.

When the page loads, the script poaches the placeholder row as a template for putting the tweets in. It also sets up handlers to call the update function.

The row.add function replaces URL's with links, and adds links to the user's profile to the image and their name.
